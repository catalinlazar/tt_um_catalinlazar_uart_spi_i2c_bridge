# How it works

A UART command interpreter drives an SPI master (4x chip-select,
configurable CPOL/CPHA) and an I2C master (clock stretching, 7-bit
addressing) over a shared 8-bit memory-mapped register file. UART
RX/TX are FIFO-buffered so bursts of commands or data don't stall the
host. See the top-level `README.md` for the full opcode table, register
map, and pinout.

# How to test

Hold `ui_in[2]` (loopback_test_en) high and issue an `SPI_XFER` (opcode
`0x03`) command over UART at 9600 baud (default): the chip should echo
back exactly the bytes you sent, since MOSI is looped to MISO
internally. Issuing `I2C_WRITE` in the same loopback mode should
reliably reply with a NACK status byte (no real I2C slave is present),
which exercises the START/ADDRESS/STOP sequencing. Connect a real SPI
or I2C peripheral (with pull-ups on `uio[0]`/`uio[1]` for I2C) and drop
`loopback_test_en` low for full end-to-end testing.

See `test/test.py` for an automated cocotb testbench covering register
read/write, SPI loopback, I2C NACK detection, and STATUS/RESET.

# External hardware

- Optional: any SPI peripheral, wired to `uo_out[1]` (SCLK),
  `uo_out[2]` (MOSI), `ui_in[1]` (MISO), and one of `uo_out[6:3]` (CS).
- Optional: any I2C peripheral on `uio[0]`/`uio[1]`, with external
  pull-up resistors (required — the design only drives these lines
  open-drain low).
- A USB-UART adapter on `ui_in[0]`/`uo_out[0]` for sending commands.
